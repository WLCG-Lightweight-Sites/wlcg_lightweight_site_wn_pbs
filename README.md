# wlcg_lightweight_site_wn_pbs

A Lightweight Site Component Repository for UMD-3 Worker Node using Torque 2.5/ Maui 1.2 hosted on SL6/EL6/CC6 distributions.

## Current Status

The project is still in development. Currenty YAIM is being used to test if a higher level specification can provide the required configuration parameters to different configuration management tools that can be used to configure the containers. In the coming weeks, we we migrate away from YAIM and use popular tools like puppet, ansible to configure these containers more flexibly.
